| ESCAPE THE HOOD v1 HUSTLE GUIDE 💰🔥                                                                                      |
| Step 1: Gear Up 🛠️                                                                                                       |
| - Snag a burner laptop (pawn shop, $100 cash, Walmart prepaid card—keep it ghost) and a USB (SanDisk 32GB, $8, eBay cash). |
| - No real names, cuh! 🕵️‍♂️                                                                                            |
| - Download Python—64-bit [https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.0/python-3.12.0-amd64.exe] or 32-bit                   |
|   [https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.0/python-3.12.0-386.exe]. Install silent—double-click, hit yes, done. 🐍    |
| - Get VLC [https://get.vlc-app.com/click.php?key=vlc_windows64&destination=latest-stable] for Punchmade Dev tunes—install quick. 🎶 |
| - Save `escape_the_hood_v1.py` from wherever you got this—drop it on your burner desktop. 📜                             |
| Step 2: Kick Off on Windows 💻                                                                                            |
| - Run the Script: Double-click `escape_the_hood_v1.py` or open a cmd (type `cmd` in search, hit enter), drag the script in, smash enter. If Python ain’t there, it’ll prompt—hit ‘y’ to install, ‘o’ if you got it. 🏃‍♂️ |
| - Install Deps: Script asks for pip and VLC—hit ‘y’ to grab ‘em. Pip pulls all the magic (`requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, etc.)—let it cook. If it fucks up, retry, cuh. 🔧 |
| - Tor, Proton, VPN: Script installs Tor Browser, ProtonVPN, MullvadVPN—hit ‘y’ for each. Tor [https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/13.5.6/tor-browser-windows-x86_64-portable-13.5.6.exe], Proton [https://protonvpn.com/download/ProtonVPN_win_v3.2.11.exe], Mullvad [https://mullvad.net/media/mullvad-vpn-2024.6.exe]. Fire up Mullvad, connect—stay ghost! 🌐 |
| Step 3: Tails OS Setup 🕴️                                                                                                |
| - Snag Tails: Grab the latest Tails ISO [https://tails.net/install/]—download it to your USB folder. 🖱️                |
| - Get Rufus: Cop Rufus [https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/releases/download/v4.6/rufus-4.6.exe]—drop it next to Tails ISO. 🛠️ |
| - Flash USB: Plug in your USB, run `rufus-4.6.exe`, pick Tails ISO, hit Start. When it’s done, reboot your rig, mash F12 (or your BIOS key), boot from USB. Script asks if you hit Tails—say ‘n’, follow prompts, then ‘y’ when done. 🖥️ |
| - Ghost Up: Tails boots—set up persistent storage (Welcome Screen > Persistent Storage > Create), save the script to `/live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/`. Open Terminal (`Applications > System Tools > Terminal`), type `chmod +x escape_the_hood_v1.py`, then `./escape_the_hood_v1.py`. 🌐 |
| Step 4: Hunt Fullz, Plugs, SOL on Tails 🕵️‍♂️                                                                            |
| - Run Script on Tails: Script fires up—installs curl, Tor, Proton, and deps. Drop a 5-digit zip (e.g., "60601") in "Plug"—pick Fullz, ZaZa (weed, loud, gas, dank), or Shrooms (mushies, caps, boomers). "New Plug Hunt" scraps Pastebin, TorPaste, BreachForums, Exploit.in, DarkMarket, Dread, Telegram, Darkwebmarketlist, HackForums, RaidForums—ranks plugs by risk (1%-35%). 💸 |
| - SOL Scrape: Flip "SOL Scraper" on, drop your Phantom address in "SOL Address"—it snags SOL keys, sends ‘em to your wallet. Check Phantom later for that bread. 🍞 |
| - Crew Comms: In "Crew Comms", test it—sender `LilCrash`, receiver `TrapKing`, message "Yo, we stackin’!"—then flip it, sender `TrapKing`, receiver `LilCrash`, message "Bread comin’ in hot!". Both hit your Discord general chat. 📞 |
| - Yank USB: When Matrix window’s full of plugs or SOL’s stacked, yank the USB—ghost out, cuh! 🚪                       |
| Step 5: Tool Up on Windows 🔨                                                                                             |
| - Boot Back to Windows: Reboot to Windows, run `escape_the_hood_v1.py` again—say ‘y’ to Tails done. Hit "Guide", check Step 4—it’ll prompt installs. 💻 |
| - Burner Kit: Script installs MagStriper, MSR605X_Driver, NFCTools, ACR122U_Driver, JcopEnglish, VeraCrypt—hit ‘y’ for all. If card writer flops later, it’ll retry these. Keep ‘em in the script folder. 🛠️ |
| - Card Writer: In "Card Writer", drop Track 1 (e.g., `%B1234567812345678^JOHN/DOE^25051011000?`), Track 2 (e.g., `;1234567812345678=25051011000?`), Track 3 (optional), Chip Data (EMV raw if you got it). Hit "Write Card"—first try glitches, retry works if tools are there. Card info hits your "jugg" bot on Discord. 💳 |
| - Trap Enhancements: Use "Burner Email" (ProtonMail burner), "TOR Browser" (fires Tor), "VPN Switch" (toggles Mullvad)—all live in the menu. Keep ‘em rollin’! 🌐 |
| Step 6: Cash Out at ATMs 💵                                                                                               |
| - Hit the Streets: Take your written card to an ATM—stack $500-$1k/day. Test small first—$20-$50—if it slaps, go big. Stay lowkey, rotate spots, cuh! 🏧 |
| - Flip Cash: Meet up via LocalMonero (https://localmonero.co/)—trade cash for XMR, no trace. Or keep it raw, your call. 💸 |
| Extra: Flip to SOL 🌞                                                                                                     |
| - Phantom Wallet: Open Phantom (installed in Step 5), make a wallet—write seed on paper, no pics! Drop XMR on Changelly (https://changelly.com/), flip to SOL, send to Phantom address. Check Phantom—stacked clean! 🌐 |
| - Wipe It: Back in script, hit Step 5 in "Guide"—say ‘y’ when done, it wipes all traces. Ghost out, cuh! 🧹           |
| Tips 🎯                                                                                                                  |
| - Stay Ghost: VPN on, no real info—burner everything. If "Error: Secure Connection Required!" pops, enter an 8-key password (it’s the 4-digit time, trollin’ feds)—2 fails, PC smokes. 😂 |
| - Plug Moves: In "Plug", say ‘y’ to negotiate—script drops moves to dodge scams and stack safe. 📞                   |
| - Trap Shit: Use all 15 tools—Burner Line, Burner Email, Trap Map, X Snitch, Monero Swap, Plug Vouch, Crew Comms, Card Writer, Dice Game, Trap Code, Fake ID, Street GPS, Hood News, TOR Browser, VPN Switch—all live, all dynamic. Keep hustlin’, cuh! 🔥 |
